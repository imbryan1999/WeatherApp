# WeatherApp
*This is the Weather App which is the fetch the data from the REST API. 

*I am using Volley library to get the data with the help of JSON and also load the pictures with the help of Picasso. 

*In this app a user can search any city, country , places. 

*After clicking the search it shows the weather condition of that particular place like temperature, latitude etc.
